"""Runtime-plasticity (Baldwin-effect) execution for chem-tape §v2.5-plasticity-1a.

Rank-1 operator-threshold plasticity: every GT operation in a decoded program
shares a single learnable scalar modifier ``delta`` (one float per program —
"rank 1"). During the **train phase** of evaluation, ``delta`` is updated via
a sign-gradient rule:

    * false-negative (label=1, pred=0): ``delta += plasticity_delta``
    * false-positive (label=0, pred=1): ``delta -= plasticity_delta``

up to ``plasticity_budget`` updates per evaluation. After training, ``delta``
is frozen for the held-out **test phase**. The GT comparison becomes
``a > (b - delta)`` — a positive ``delta`` shifts the threshold DOWN, making
GT more likely to fire (correctly increasing positive rate when the program
was under-predicting).

Scope and intentional limitations
---------------------------------
* Only GT is plastic in this rank-1 probe. The prereg mentions GT/LT/EQ as
  "comparison operators", but the v1/v2_probe alphabets currently expose only
  GT as a stack op (id 8); LT/EQ do not exist. The delta is thus applied to
  GT tokens only. If LT/EQ are ever added, extend ``_gt_shifted`` accordingly.
* IF_GT's internal ``cond > 0`` check is NOT plasticised — the prereg pins
  the modifier to comparison-operators-on-the-stack semantics, and IF_GT's
  internal cond check is a control-flow positivity test rather than a general
  comparison.
* Execution is pure-Python. The frozen fast-path in ``evaluate.py`` continues
  to use the Rust executor when available; plastic execution runs in Python
  because the per-individual δ state is not Rust-accelerated. This is an
  acknowledged compute cost of the plastic probe.

When ``ChemTapeConfig.plasticity_enabled=False`` (default), this module is
NEVER imported at evaluation time — ``evaluate.py`` dispatches through the
unmodified Rust/Python fast-path and produces byte-identical final-population
dumps (principle 23).

    each produce one update, after which δ is frozen even if further train
    examples are still misclassified. This caps ``|δ_final|`` at
